       <h2> “Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19” </h2>

                    
<p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully 
vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still 
isn’t the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that 
you could become infected.
      <br> 
Dr. Cardona explains. 
       <br>
“‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for 
the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No 
vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off 
the infectious consequences of being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”</p><br><br>

<h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to<br> 
others, including other vaccinated people?</h2><br><br>

<p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower 
rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune 
response to vaccines.<br>

“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health 
disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19
vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in 
these vulnerable populations.”</p>
